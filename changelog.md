- Replace `Color` struct with `Pixel` struct
  - Renaming prevents namespace collision with `System.Drawing.Color`
  - Moved to root of project directory
  - Explicit field layout defined allowing 4-byte storage for the red, gree, blue, and green components and an additional `Rgba` field that supplies the `uint` packed value without additional storage.
- Moved blend logic to `BlendFunctions` class
  - Separates logic out of the struct representing color values (`Pixel`)
  - Uses `ref` for `backdrop` params to prevent value copying across all blend functions
- Moved `MUL_UN8` and `DIV_UN8` to Pixman/Combine32.cs.  Added appropriate license in file header.
