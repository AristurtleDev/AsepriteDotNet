- Replace `Color` struct with `Pixel` struct
  - Renaming prevents namespace collision with `System.Drawing.Color`
  - Moved to root of project directory
  - Explicit field layout defined allowing 4-byte storage for the red, gree, blue, and green components and an additional `Rgba` field that supplies the `uint` packed value without additional storage.
